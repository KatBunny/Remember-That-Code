Game Title: "Remember That Code!" 

# Intro:Hello There:
This is a card matching game designed to help the memory easily access the basics of html, DOM, css, and JavaScript so that we don't waste time googling the most basic things while coding a webpage.

It is important to create projects that I will personally use and I have been look for a good online study tool for a while now. There are many proven benefits found in using flash cards (see below): The main goal that should be achieve through playing this game consistently is to create memory retention to help maintain the most basic groundwork learned in fast paced education that is learned in coding bootcamps and to also sharpen the memory of those who just don't remimber concepts sometimes. The ultimate plan is to help guide our brain to transfer information from the working memory, then to the short-term memory, and  eventually to the long term memory.
Since this game is designed to be a study tool, The overall format will be designed with flash cards  and/or card matching games as a templet because these games force recall skills and are meant to be quick to play as well as uncomplicated to use.

Here are some expected benefits of playing this game:

*active recall
*Testing the strength of your brain
*testing coherent understanding of material.
*become better at concepts 
*matching terminology to specific problems.

###Wireframe

#user Experience

*I want the user to know if what score they have.
* I want the user to be able to login and save progress to compare.
*I want the user to easily navigate the site: quit current matching cell subject and to start on a new subject if they please or just to be able to quit altogether. 
This game should be accessible through a web page. Their will be dropdown menus or maybe buttons that offer different subject options of what basic concepts that you would like to study today.



####Contributers
This game project will be on a public git hub profile so that others who want to customize it to their needs may fork and clone and edit it for themselves as a study tool that makes more sense for them. I would like to also see other programmers that can add improvements to this game.


######MVP

I want basic wireframe in place and 1 basic subject cell of cards in place. I want the user experience to exist full.

*Extra: 2 more subject cells and some color.
*Extra, Extra: 5 subject cells minimum, color to cards, and sound bites.

--Project timeline.
*I want MVP done by Wednesday (1.3). 
*I want to try to have and extra in place by Friday(1.4).
*I want to only focus on fixing bugs and getting all function done by due date.
