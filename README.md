Game Title: "Remember That Code!" 

#intro:This game can help build memory on using coding basics by matching code to how it translates as a function within the code you are studying at that time.

This project is a concentration/memory game created with myself and other new web developers in mind. While going through a coding bootcamp or just simply trying to sharpen memory of basic coding skills, we tend to learn a lot, yet we forget most of what we learn almost as quickly as we learned it. Since retention of our fast paced education tends to be short lived, this game will be designed to help our brain guide information from the working memory to the short-term memory, and  eventually to the long term memory through some consistent practice.   Since this game is designed to be a study tool, it will be designed with flash cards  and/or card matching games because these games force recall skills and are meant to be quick to use and uncomplicated.
Here are some expected benefits of playing this game:

*active recall
*Testing the strength of your brain
*testing coherent understanding of material.
*become better at concepts 
*matching terminology to specific problems.

###Wireframe

#user Experience

*I want the user to know if what score they have.
* I want the user to be able to login and save progress to compare.
*I want the user to easily navigate the site: quit current matching cell subject and to start on a new subject if they please or just to be able to quit altogether. 
This game should be accessible through a web page. Their will be dropdown menus or maybe buttons that offer different subject options of what basic concepts that you would like to study today.



####Contributers
This game project will be on a public git hub profile so that others who want to customize it to their needs may fork and clone and edit it for themselves as a study tool that makes more sense for them. I would like to also see other programmers that can add improvements to this game.


######MVP

I want basic wireframe in place and 1 basic subject cell of cards in place. I want the user experience to exist full.

*Extra: 2 more subject cells and some color.
*Extra, Extra: 5 subject cells minimum, color to cards, and sound bites.

--Project timeline.
*I want MVP done by Wednesday (1.3). 
*I want to try to have and extra in place by Friday(1.4).
*I want to only focus on fixing bugs and getting all function done by due date.
