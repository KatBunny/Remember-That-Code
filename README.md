### Hello, welcome to "Remember that code"; this is a game designed to help yo study common terms that are important to remember as you are just starting your web dev journey. 

#### The game is designed to be a memory game designed with flip cards that flip as the cursor hovers over a particular card. When a match is recognized it dissappears. When there are no more matches, then you have completed a succesful study lesson.

#### There aren't many rules, however, there is a beginning of game score set at 100 points and every time you miss a match a 5 point score will be reduced, so be careful not to click unless you mean it!
