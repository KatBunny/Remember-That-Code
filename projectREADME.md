#KatherineSinkler Coding Memory Game

#intro:This game can help build memory on using coding basics by matching code to how it translates as a function within the code you are studying at that time.

This project is a concentration/memory game created with myself and other new web developers in mind. While going through a coding bootcamp or just simply trying to sharpen memory of basic coding skills, we tend to learn a lot, yet we forget most of what we learn almost as quickly as we learned it. Since retention of our fast paced education tends to be short lived, this game will be designed to help our brain guide information from the working memory to the short-term memory, and  eventually to the long term memory through some consistent practice.   Since this game is designed to be a study tool, it will be designed with flash cards  and/or card matching games because these games force recall skills and are meant to be quick to use and uncomplicated.
Here are some expected benefits of playing this game:

*active recall
*Testing the strength of your brain
*testing coherent understanding of material.
*become better at concepts 
*matching terminology to specific problems.

#user Experience

This game should be accessible through a web page. Their will be dropdown menus or maybe buttons that offer different subject options of what basic concepts that you would like to study today.

####Contributers
This game project will be on a public git hub profile so that others who want to customize it to their needs may fork and clone and edit it for themselves as a study tool that makes more sense for them. I would like to also see other programmers that can add improvements to this game.
